/**
 * Spins for a short time, then sleeps on a wait condition until the publisher signals. This comes
 * at a cost, however: the publisher has to perform an extra read-modify-write operation on a shared
 * atomic variable every time it publishes new items. The operation should be uncontended, unless it
 * happens at the same time that a waiter is about to fall asleep. See below for details and a proof
 * of correctness.
 *
 * # Design issues
 *
 * When a waiting task goes to sleep, it cannot sleep without a timeout unless it is certain that
 * the publisher will wake it up when the next slot is published. The conventional solution to this
 * problem would be to have the publisher acquire a lock after every publish, to guarantee that
 * waiting consumers are woken up immediately. This would impose a prohibitive performance penalty
 * if it happened here. In the common case, where the publisher does not need to signal, it would be
 * good to avoid using locks altogether. However, any alternative solutions need to make the
 * following guarantees:
 *  - If a consumer decides to wait, the publisher must signal when it releases the slot that the
 *    consumer was waiting for
 *  - The publisher must signal _after_ the consumer has fallen asleep, or the consumer will not be
 *    woken up
 *
 * # Approach
 *
 * We need a way for the publisher to synchronize with potential waiters at the point where it
 * checks if it needs to signal or not. If it finds that it does not need to signal, we need to be
 * able to prove that the consumer will not sleep. If it does see a need to signal, then it must be
 * assured that it will do so after the consumer has fallen asleep.
 *
 * # Algorithm
 *
 * The publisher executes the following steps whenever releasing items:
 *  - Release items via an atomic operation with release semantics (before calling notify_all_waiters)
 *  - Check if there are any waiters using a read-modify-write operation on a shared variable (with
 *    rel-acq semantics)
 *  - If so, acquire the lock and signal on the wait condition
 *
 * The consumer executes the following steps before going to sleep:
 *  - Acquire the lock
 *  - Express an intent to sleep using a read-modify-write operation (with rel-acq semantics) on the
 *    shared variable
 *  - Check for any newly released items
 *  - If none, go to sleep, otherwise release the lock and finish waiting
 *
 * # Proof of correctness
 *
 * Two things need to be proven to show correctness:
 *  - the publisher will signal when necessary
 *  - the signal happens only after the waiter(s) have gone to sleep.
 *
 * Due to the use of read-modify-write operations, the race between publisher and consumer to access
 * the shared variable has two simple outcomes: either the publisher checks first and refrains from
 * signalling, or the consumer signals intent to sleep first, which the publisher will then see and
 * act upon.
 *
 * If the publisher accesses the shared variable before consumer has signalled intent to sleep: as
 * long as the item has been released before the access, we can say that:
 *  - the item release happens before the publisher's shared variable access
 *  - which happens before the consumer's shared variable access
 *  - which happens before the consumer's final check for a newly released item before sleeping
 * Therefore, if the publisher concludes that it doesn't need to signal, it is certain that the
 * consumer will see the newly released item and refrain from sleeping. In other words, a consumer
 * cannot go to sleep without the publisher seeing its intent to do so.
 *
 * An alternate proof based on the consumer deciding to sleep: due to acquire semantics on the
 * shared variable access, we know that the consumer accesses the shared variable before checking
 * for available items.  If the consumer, after taking the lock but before going to sleep, doesn't
 * see a newly released item, the following happens-before ordering is implied: consumer shared
 * variable access -> consumer check for new item -> publisher release of new item -> publisher
 * access of shared variable. Therefore, if the waiter decides to sleep after seeing no progress
 * from the publisher, we can say for sure that the publisher will see the signalled intent to
 * sleep, acquire the lock, and signal on the wait condition.
 *
 * Regarding the second issue of whether the waiter goes to sleep before the signal wakes it up,
 * observe that the consumer only expresses intent to sleep (through the shared variable) after
 * acquiring the lock. Thus, the producer cannot see the signal until after the consumer acquires
 * the lock, and cannot acquire the lock and signal until after the consumer has atomically released
 * the lock and slept.
 *
 * Unfortunately, this proof depends on having release semantics on the publisher side, and acquire
 * semantics on the waiting side. Release semantics require a store operation, while Acquire
 * semantics require a load operation. Therefore, the publisher needs to load the shared variable to
 * see if it needs to signal or not, while simultaneously storing to it in order to gain release
 * semantics.  Likewise, in addition to modifying the shared variable to signal intent, the waiters
 * need to also perform a load in order to have acquire semantics. This is why read-modify-write
 * operations are needed, and not just the cheaper load/store operations.

/**
 * Now, implement a resizable version of the disruptor. After waiting sufficiently long enough for
 * the consumer pipeline to release slots, the publisher will instead allocate a new, larger, ring
 * buffer, write a special value to the corresponding slot in the old ring buffer, and store the
 * actual value in the new ring buffer. A pointer from the old buffer to the new one is also
 * written. The publisher then makes these changes visible to the downstream pipeline by
 * incrementing its sequence value. If the value has wrapped recently, the publisher bumps it back
 * above the consumers' sequence values, to avoid ambiguity resulting from the larger buffer size.
 * Finally, the last consumer in the pipeline deallocates the old buffer before moving on to the
 * larger buffer. Currently, the lifetime of old buffers is managed via reference counting.
 *
 * NOTE: Latency sensitive applications should not use this mode: the unbounded queue buildup will
 * increase latency outside of acceptable levels. Instead, they should gracefully handle excess
 * demand by providing whatever feedback is needed to reduce upstream demand to levels that the
 * application can handle. For example, this may involve dropping packets, queueing users that try
 * to open new sessions (to avoid degrading service for existing sessions), skipping frames, or any
 * other mechanism that reduces demand as early as possible to avoid wasted effort.
 *
 * # Availability calculation following reallocation
 *
 * Although it's not strictly necessary, things are most efficient if the publisher immediately uses
 * all of the slots in the newly allocated buffer without waiting for the consumer. After resizing
 * the buffer, the publisher will start using the increased buffer size in availability
 * calculations. This allows the publisher to use (new_size - old_size) extra slots, but it leaves
 * old_size slots unused.
 *
 * To fix this, the publisher manipulates its cached availability value to reflect the extra
 * available slots. This avoids the need to add extra code and state just to solve this problem.
 *
 * # Example
 *
 * Imagine a ring buffer of size 4. All stages in the pipeline start with a sequence of 0. The
 * publisher publishes 15 items, which leaves its sequence number at 15. For this to be possible,
 * the consumer(s) must have processed some of the items, since the buffer size, 4, is less than 15.
 * Actually, only 3 elements are available in the buffer, the 4th is reserved as a way for the
 * publisher to communicate that it has allocated another buffer. The publisher then publishes its
 * 16th item into the slot corresponding to sequence 15. When it increments its sequence number, it
 * wraps back down to 0, because the wrap boundary is 16 (four times the buffer size).
 *
 * Now, let's imagine the application is somehow written to contain a deadlock. For example, the
 * consumer is receiving from the publisher via two different communication channels, and it waits
 * for the publisher to send something on the second, while the publisher is waiting for the
 * consumer to process items from the first. When the resizing support is in use, the publisher will
 * eventually decide to reallocate a larger buffer of size 8.
 *
 * During the reallocation, the final consumer's sequence number is at least 13 (`16 - (buffer_size
 * - 1)`), since the publisher has been taking care to leave an extra slot free in case a
 * reallocation is needed. The consumer's sequence will never exceed the publisher's, except through
 * wrapping, so we can also say that it is logically at most 16, where 16 would be wrapped to 0.
 * Therefore, the consumer's sequence value could be any of {13, 14, 15, 0}.  The publisher's
 * sequence value is 0 until reallocation is complete, at which point it will be unwrapped back to
 * 16, and incremented to 17. One important thing to note is that regardless of whether the
 * publisher's sequence value was 0, 4, 8, or 12, it will be unwrapped to 16.
 *
 * If the consumer's sequence value was 13 prior to the reallocation, then there were 0 slots
 * available for the publisher to use: with a buffer size of 4, the last slot available to the
 * publisher would have been at sequence value 16, minus the one slot that was reserved for
 * signalling reallocations. In other words, 15 was the last available slot, and the publisher has
 * already used it.
 *
 * After the reallocation, though, the availability calculation would be using the larger buffer
 * size of 8, and as a result would conclude that the last available slot is 20 (subtracting one
 * leaves 19), so the publisher is now able to publish 4 more times into slots 16-19. However, there
 * are actually 7 more slots available (8 minus the one reserved slot). To use the extra slots, the
 * publisher modifies its cached availability value to indicate that 7 slots are available.  This
 * allows it to immediately publish into slots 20, 21, and 22 as well, leaving its sequence value at
 * 23 instead of 20.
 *
 * This results in several new special cases to handle versus the usual non-resizing variant:
 * - From the consumer's perspective, there may be more than `buffer_size` slots available, because
 * the publisher has started publishing into the new buffer.
 * - When calculating availability from the publisher's perspective, the consumer sequence that
 * gates its publishing may be more than `buffer_size` slots behind. The availability calculation
 * needs to return 0 in this case.
 * - It becomes important to ensure that the publisher does not wrap until the consumer pipeline has
 * transitioned to the new buffer, to avoid breaking the consumer's availability calculations.
 *
 * The publisher's availability calculation function was rewritten to correctly handle the second
 * point, and the wrap boundary was changed to `4*buffer_size` to facilitate the third point.
